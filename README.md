# Fine Wine

Have you ever wanted to become a wine connoisseur? Me neither. Save yourself the hassle and generate your own wine descriptions right in your command line.

## Usage

Run `python fine-wine.py`. That's it.

If you want to use your own word lists, save them in the root directory as `nouns.txt` and `adjectives.txt`.

## Data sources
